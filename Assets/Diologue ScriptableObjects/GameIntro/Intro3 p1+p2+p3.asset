    - Child, I have learned to be cautious in this world. My past is one of pain
      and loss, as the last of the Phoenix race. The hunters sought to profit from
      our feathers, to stop aging, but my family and friends sacrificed themselves
      to give me their energy. Now, I reside in this secluded forest, alone with
      my thoughts and memories. I carry the weight of their names with me always;
      Shamin, Dainsel, Aena, Soro, Bali, Torin, and Kubuka. I strive to learn and
      grow, yet I cannot help but fear the day when others may seek my power for
      their own selfish gain.
